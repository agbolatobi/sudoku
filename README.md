## Overview
The Program Implements a sudoku solver. The program asks for the size of the grid which must be a perfect square integer and then the program requests for the list of characters in the grid. Then a string of the square of the grid size in inputted. After the inputs are validated a grid of objects is created and then the grid is passed to a solver object that attempts to solve the grid. The grid is solved with a back tracking recursive algorithm that uses brute force to solve the sudoku puzzle  by trying all possible valid inputs until we find the right sequence of valid inputs.
## File and External data
The main files correspond to the classes in the game. 

 - **Main.java**:This is the main class where all the objects are called, and the input are accepted and validated.

 - **Grid.java**:This is the class of the grid object it stores a multi-dimensional of type sudokuElement represents the game. The object of this class is passed a solver object

 - **Solver.java**:This class takes in a grid object and solves the puzzle with a back tracking recursive algorithm. It contains validators to detect when a grid is fully solved  

 - **SudokuElement.java**:The objects of the class represent each cell in the grid. It stores the value of each cell.

## Data structures and their relations to each otherâ€™s
**Grid object**: this stores the multi- dimensional array grid  of sudokuElement objects. It also stores the integer gridSize and a set gridCharacters.

**SudokuElement object**: this object stores the value of each sudoku cell in a String value. 

**Solver object**: takes in the Grid Object and solves the puzzle.

**Grid multi-dimensional array**: store all the elements of the puzzle of type sudokuElement.

**Integer gridSize**: store the size of the grid.

**Set gridCharacters**: store a set of the characters in the grid.
 

## Assumptions
 - The size of the grid is a perfect square 
 - The number of unique characters is equal to the side of the grid
 - The sudoku puzzle has a solution 
 - The solution is not the worst-case scenario for the  recursive backtracking algorithm
 - The number of characters in the input string is equal to number of elements in the grid

## Key algorithms and design elements 
Recursive backtracking: This is an algorithm that used to solve computational problems it involves exploring possible options and backtracking the moment an option is not possible or invalid. It is a form of brute force algorithm and is useful for state space exploration problems.
Limitations 
 - The program slows down as the grid size increases and the when the elements are arranged the worst-case scenario for a brute force algorithm. 
 - The grid size must be a perfect square.
